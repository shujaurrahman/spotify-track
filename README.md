# Integrate Spotify with Your Website: A Comprehensive Guide


## Introduction

In this guide, we'll integrate Spotify's Web API into your website. I'll explain how to set up your project, configure environment variables, understand the code, and ensure everything works seamlessly.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- A Spotify Developer account
- PHP installed on your local machine
- Composer for managing PHP dependencies

## Project Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

Begin by cloning the repository from GitHub to your local development environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shujaurrahman/spotify-track
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Ensure Composer is installed on your machine. Run the following command to install all necessary PHP packages:

```bash
composer install
```

This command creates a `vendor/` directory containing all required dependencies as specified in `composer.json`.

## Configuration

### 1. Create and Configure the `.env` File

The `.env` file is crucial for managing sensitive data such as API keys. Create a file named `.env` in the root of your project with the following content:

```plaintext
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost/spotify-track/access.php
```

**Explanation:**

- **SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID**: Your Spotify application's Client ID. Obtain this from the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard) by creating a new application.
- **SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET**: Your Spotify application's Client Secret, also available on the Spotify Developer Dashboard.
- **SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI**: The URL where Spotify will redirect users after authorization. Ensure this URI matches one of the redirect URIs set up in your Spotify app settings.

**Important:** To keep your sensitive information secure, do not push the `.env` file to a public repository. Add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file to prevent it from being tracked by Git.

### 2. Project Structure

Here's an overview of the project structure and key files:

```
/project-root
    ├── vendor/
    ├── tokens.json
    ├── index.php
    ├── access.php
    ├── includes/
    │   ├── spotify_handler.php
    │   └── auth.php
    ├── .env
    ├── composer.json
    ├── composer.lock
    └── style.css
```

- **`vendor/`**: Contains all PHP dependencies installed via Composer.
- **`tokens.json`**: Stores access and refresh tokens for Spotify API authentication.
- **`index.php`**: The main entry point that handles fetching and displaying track information.
- **`access.php`**: Manages Spotify OAuth authorization and token retrieval.
- **`includes/spotify_handler.php`**: Contains functions for interacting with the Spotify API, such as token management and track fetching.
- **`includes/auth.php`**: Handles the OAuth process and authorization code exchange.
- **`style.css`**: Contains styles for the project, ensuring a clean and minimalistic design.

## Understanding the Code

### 1. Environment Configuration

The `.env` file is loaded using the `Dotenv` PHP library, which securely manages your API credentials. This keeps sensitive data out of the main codebase.

### 2. Token Management

- **Fetching Tokens**: Tokens are retrieved from `tokens.json`. If they are expired, the application refreshes them using the Spotify API.
- **Saving Tokens**: Updated tokens are saved back to `tokens.json`, ensuring the application always has valid credentials.

### 3. Spotify API Integration

- **Fetching Track Information**: `index.php` makes API requests to Spotify to get the currently playing or recently played track. It then displays this information using HTML and CSS.
- **Displaying Track Information**: The track details are rendered with HTML, showcasing the track name, artist, album, and cover image.

## Authorization Process

On your first visit after setting up the project, you'll need to complete the authorization process. Follow these steps:

1. **Click the "Authorize" Button**: On the index page, you'll see an "Authorize" button. Clicking this button will initiate the authorization process.

2. **Automatic Authorization**: The authorization process is handled automatically by the backend. When you click the "Authorize" button, it triggers a script (`auth.php`) that uses your `.env` credentials to complete the OAuth flow.

3. **Token Storage**: Once the authorization is successful, the access token is saved to `tokens.json`. This token is essential for making authenticated requests to the Spotify API.

4. **Confirmation Message**: After successful authorization, a confirmation message will be displayed on the index page, informing you that the setup is complete.

5. **Button Removal**: You can remove or hide the "Authorize" button after the initial setup. This button is only needed for the first-time setup and will not be required for regular usage.

**Why Authorization Is Needed:**

- **Accessing User Data**: Authorization allows the application to access Spotify's Web API on behalf of the user, fetching information like currently playing or recently played tracks.
- **Token Security**: Storing the token securely in `tokens.json` ensures that subsequent requests can be made without requiring reauthorization.

## Testing and Deployment

### 1. Local Testing

Run your local development server and navigate to `http://localhost/spotify-track/index.php` in your browser to test the integration.

### 2. Deployment

When deploying to a live server, ensure:

- The `.env` file is correctly configured with production values.
- The `tokens.json` file is writable by the server.

## Conclusion

With this setup, you can successfully integrate Spotify into your website, offering users a dynamic way to interact with music. If you have any questions or encounter issues, refer to the [Spotify API Documentation](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) for additional help.

Feel free to reach out with any questions or feedback!

Replace placeholders such as `your-client-id` and `your-client-secret` with actual values from your Spotify Developer Dashboard. Adjust any specifics as needed to fit your actual setup.
